    <h2>Desciption</h2>
    <p>Born vegan, this is a classic potato salad that can be found on Italian tables from the North to the South.</p>
    <p> In Italy, you'll find it everywhere: formal luncheons, family get-togethers, weeknight dinners, and even in hospital and school cafeterias.</p>
    <p> Many Italians add cooked green beans. Leftovers are delicious tossed with pesto and pasta. Buon appetito!</p>
